Goal of the game is to reach the total crystals randomly generated number byt clicking on each superhero's image. 

The superheros are randomly assigned a value from 1-12. No two superheroes will hold the same value. 

If the player reaches the random number exactly, then the win counter is plus one and the game resets. 

If the player goes over the random number, then the loss counter is plus one and the game resets.
